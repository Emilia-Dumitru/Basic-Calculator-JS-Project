## 🚀 How to Run the Project?
1. **Clone the repository** or download the files
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. Use the buttons to perform calculations

---

## 📌 Technical Explanation
- **Click events** are handled using `addEventListener`, linking each button to the `calcResult()` function.
- **Mathematical operations** are processed using `eval()`, but operators `×` and `÷` are converted to `*` and `/`.
- **Special functions** (e.g., square, square root, 1/x) are handled using `Math.sqrt()`, `**2`, and other JavaScript operations.
